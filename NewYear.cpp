/*   Happy New Year!
Currently, it is X:00 hours on December 31st  and you are wondering how many hours are left till midnight.
For the purposes of this problem, we use a 24 hour system. So, X can range from 0 to 23,
and you need to tell the number of hours left till 00:00 of the next day.*/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
        // your code goes here
        int X;
        cin >> X;
        cout << 24 - X << endl;
}
